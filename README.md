LIXEIRA ROBÃ”

Summary:
This project is a robot trash can, it uses computer vision with OpenCV using the cascade technique to identify logos, communicating with the structure's hardware from an Arduino Uno that uses an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor for procedural detection and a servo motor for lid opening.

When the object approaches the trash can, detection is activated via serial communication between the Arduino and the computer. After checking, the information about whether or not the trash can open the lid is also sent via serial communication.

Tecnologys:
- opencv
- python
- Arduino
